## What is Amazon Lightsail?

Amazon Lightsail is part of Amazon Web Services, which is itself a subsidiary of Amazon.com (gotta love corporate infrastructure). Lightsail allows you to rent cloud servers, or 'virtual machines', with many attractive low-cost choices. It has easy options for scaling your hosted projects as more and more users access them, and integrates seamlessly with other great services AWS provides. Setting up a Lightsail server is relatively simple and can be accomplished quickly - assuming you don't run into serious issues.

This article will focus on the steps necessary to host a client-side only (no server) React project on Amazon Lightsail. If your project isn't purely frontend, this guide will still help you most of the way. This guide also assumes the use of 'create-react-app' as the project's bootstrap.

---

## Step 1: Purchase Your Virtual Machine

[Head here to get started!](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) 

On AWS' portal, create an account if you don't already have one and enter payment information to gain access to your Lightsail home page. Once there, click the **Create an Instance** button to set up the virtual machine. You'll want to select a **Linux/Unix** server, as well as toggle to **OS Only**. The Linux flavor this guide will cover is **Ubuntu**, so make sure that one is highlighted. Pick an option that you can afford or that you think will fulfill your needs for now, and keep an eye out for any specials or promotions (free first month, etc). You can always upgrade your virtual machine's capabilities later on if you need to. 

Double check that the correct price and configuration is selected, then enter a custom name for this instance if you wish. Finally, click **Create Instance** to finish the process.

---

## Step 2: Configure SSH Login

### Set a Static IP

You should now see your machine's status card in the **Instances** tab of your Lightsail home page. Before moving on, we need to set a static IP address for our instance so we don't have to re-enter a new IP every time it changes. Navigate to the **Networking** tab and click **Create static IP**. Follow the instructions to link the IP address to your newly created instance. Then, head back to **Instances** and click the terminal button on the status card (it has a ">_" on it). Put on your hacker hat and sunglasses - you're in!

### Add New Super User

Now that you're logged in, let's add a custom user to the system. This new profile will be the one you'll use to login and manage your machine in the future. 

All of the example code in this article will use placeholders for your own entries, so keep a sharp eye and be sure to substitute things like "your_username" or "your_domain.com" with your desired values.

Enter the following command in the Lightsail terminal:

```
sudo adduser your_username
```

Set a strong UNIX password as prompted, and enter user information as needed (it's fine to leave these fields blank).

You just created a basic user on your virtual machine. Let's grant it 'superuser' capabilities to make our lives easier going forward. This will enable the `sudo` command on the profile so you can have administrative privileges:

```
usermod -aG sudo your_username
```

### Create and Copy Public Key

Next, we shall secure our server by requiring an SSH key to log in using the new profile. If you don't already have an SSH key pair, open a *new terminal on your local computer* and enter:

```
ssh-keygen
```

Something like the following will output to the terminal:

```
ssh-keygen output
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/localuser/.ssh/id_rsa):
Hit return to accept this file name and path (or enter a new name).
```

The system may ask you for a passphrase to secure the key. You can chose to enter one, or simply leave it blank. 

Now you have your own private/public key pair in the directory that was specified above. Use this command to print your public key (id_rsa.pub) to the terminal:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Once printed, it will look similar to this: 

```
id_rsa.pub contents
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDBGTO0tsVejssuaYR5R3Y/i73SppJAhme1dH7W2c47d4gOqB4izP0+fRLfvbz/tnXFz4iOP/H6eCV05hqUhF+KYRxt9Y8tVMrpDZR2l75o6+xSbUOMu6xN+uVF0T9XzKcxmzTmnV7Na5up3QM3DoSRYX/EP3utr2+zAqpJIfKPLdA74w7g56oYWI9blpnpzxkEd3edVJOivUkpZ4JoenWManvIaSdMTJXMy3MtlQhva+j9CgguyVbUkdzK9KKEuah+pFZvaugtebsU+bllPTB0nlXGIJk98Ie9ZtxuY3nCKneB+KjKiXrAvXUPCI9mWkYS/1rggpFmu3HbXBnWSUdf localuser@machine.local
```

Select and copy the public key, beginning with the `ssh-rsa` and ending with the email address if there is one.

### Add Key to Lightsail Machine

Back on the *Amazon Lightsail terminal*, switch from the default `ubuntu` user to your new one (substitute your own username):

```
su your_username
```

You are now in the home directory.

Make a new directory called `.ssh` and restrict its permissions with these commands:

```
sudo mkdir ~/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

Next, use the `nano` text editor to create and open a new file in `.ssh`:

```
sudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Insert your public key here by first pasting the key into the clipboard (click the icon on the bottom right of the terminal window), and right clicking in the empty file. To exit hit **CTRL-x**, then **y** to save, and **ENTER** to confirm the file name.

Restrict the permissions of the `authorized_keys` file for additional security:

```
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Login Using Your Computer

You now have the ability to log in to your server from your local machine. Retrieve your server's IP from the **Instances** tab, then enter this on your computer's *local terminal*:

```
ssh your_username@your_server_ip
```

After submitting your password, you should be logged in to the same virtual machine as your Lightsail terminal. Go ahead and close the Lightsail terminal - you've got remote access now, you cheeky computer wizard!

### Configure Firewall

Allow SSH connections through the server's firewall by typing:

```
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
```

Then activate the firewall with:

```
sudo ufw enable
```

---

## Step 3: Point Domain Name to Lightsail Server

Find a domain name provider to purchase your desired domain if you haven't already. Afterwards, navigate to the DNS settings and update the **A (@)** record's value to be your server's IP address. You may need to add the record yourself if it doesn't already exist. While you are here, remove any **AAA** record types to save yourself from a headache later.

Depending on the provider, this setting can take up to 48 hours to be completely applied. However, it usually takes less than 15 minutes.

---

## Step 4: Install NGINX

NGINX is a super powerful and extremely popular web server. It can act as a reverse proxy, or can serve your website's files. Over 400 million websites use NGINX open source - your project will be using one of the best solutions out there.

Back on your terminal, update your package listings and install the latest version of NGINX with `apt-get`:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

Allow NGINX access through the firewall by typing:

```
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

---

## Step 5: Install Node.js and NPM

Use Ubuntu's `curl` tool to download the Node setup script:

```
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
```

Then, run the script with `bash`:

```
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
```

After setup, install the latest Node.js package:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

Npm installs alongside Node.js here. Lastly, install the 'build-essential' package to ensure that all of our npm packages will work correctly:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

---

## Step 6: Add Project Files to Lightsail Server

Navigate to the home directory and clone your files from GitHub using these commands (make sure to swap out your own GitHub username and repo link):

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
```

Now add all your dependencies by going into the project directory and using npm install. **If you have a weaksauce server (512 MB RAM or less), follow the extra step (6.5) below before running** `npm i`!

Otherwise, pay no attention to that and simply run:

```
cd your_repository_name
npm i
```

Afterwards, run React's build script and [skip to step 7](https://github.com/Olafaloofian/React-Frontend-Lightsail-Deployment#step-7-link-the-projects-build-folder-in-the-server):

```
npm run build
```

---

## Step 6.5: Weaksauce Extras

### Making a Swap File

If you are reading this, you probably chose the thriftiest option Amazon Lightsail has to offer. There's nothing wrong with that - everyone loves to save a bit of money. The bad news about your decision is that your server doesn't have enough RAM to `npm install`. The good news? There's a super cool workaround for this in Ubuntu.

To solve our issue, we will be making a 'swap file'. This special file allows an Ubuntu machine's hard drive to take over when the RAM is full, which is perfect for our situation. Using a hard drive to transfer data takes a lot longer than relying on RAM alone, but there's really no other option here.

First, navigate to the root directory and create a swap file using the `fallocate` program (1 gigabyte should be enough for most React projects, but if you have Gatsby project, use 4 gigabytes):

```
cd /
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
```

For security, restrict this file's permissions to `root`:

```
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

Then, mark this file as swap space:

```
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

You should see something like this in the output:

```
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 1024 MiB (1073737728 bytes)
no label, UUID=6e965805-2ab9-450f-aed6-577e74089dbf
```

Finally, enable the swap file for immediate use:

```
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

If you enter this command, you should see the swap file ready to go:

```
sudo swapon --show
```

If you have an output from the previous command, you can now go back to your project folder and `npm i`:

```
cd ~/your_repository_name
npm i
```

After installation finishes (this may take a while), make your build folder with:

```
npm run build
```

### Removing the Swap File

We need to clear our swap file configs once we are done running `npm i`/`npm run build`. Amazon Lightsail uses solid state drives for its hard storage, which is great for snappy performance. However, SSD's are not built to be repeatedly overwritten with data like traditional spinning disks. For this reason, swap files are a hazard to SSD's and may quickly degrade the performance of your virtual machine's hardware.

To remove the temporary swap file, restart your server from the Lightsail home page by opening the menu on your instance and clicking **Reboot**. Wait a minute or two, then log back in on your local machine's terminal using:

```
ssh your_username@your_server_ip
```

---

## Step 7: Link the Project's Build Folder in the Server

NGINX will be looking for your website's static files in a certain directory. The default location will be `/var/www`. Navigate there and create a new folder to hold your project's build files.

```
cd /var/www/
sudo mkdir your_domain.com
```

Now, make a symbolic link to your project's build folder with the `ln -s` command:

```
sudo ln -s /home/your_username/your_repository_name/build/* /var/www/your_domain.com/
```

This link will mirror all the information from `your_repository_name/build` to the `your_domain.com` directory. It's sort of like a live copy/paste that will update itself if there are changes to the file.

---

## Step 8: Modify the NGINX Configuration Files

NGINX should be installed and ready to go, but we need to configure it to serve our website's files. There are two directories in NGINX 's configs that we will modify: `sites-enabled` and `sites-available`. Again, we will use `nano` to create and edit a new file.

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
sudo nano your_domain.com
```

Delete the default text in this file (you can do this quickly by placing your cursor at the beginning and holding **CTRL-k**). Then, enter the following information:

```
server {
 listen 80 default_server;
 listen [::]:80 default_server;
 root /var/www/your_domain.com;
 index index.html;
 server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;
 location / {
   try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
 }
}
```

This server block tells NGINX to listen on port 80, as well as specifying where the files to serve are located (with `root` and `index`). `server_name` accepts your domain names (one with `www` and one without) to route requests to these files. The `location /` entry makes sure that any paths not available in the project route the user back to `index.html` rather than causing an error.

Exit the nano editor same as before - **CTRL-x**, then **y**, then **ENTER**.

Instead of tediously backing out and retyping the information in `sites-enabled`, let's make another symbolic link:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/your_domain.com
```

Check your work for syntax errors by running:

```
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, restart your server:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Given that your domain provider has fully propagated the changes you made earlier, you should be able to view your site by entering your domain name in a browser. Epic!

---

## Step 9: Obtain SSL Certificate with Let's Encrypt

Getting an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS used to be a complicated and potentially expensive process. Luckily, an organization called Let's Encrypt came along to provide free TLS/SSL certificates and helpful tools to activate them. We will be using one of their programs called CertBot.

Add the CertBot repository for the latest version:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
```

Update the package list afterwards to pick up the new information:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Lastly, install CertBot's python/NGINX package:

```
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
```

This plugin will do most of the work needed to get and maintain a security certificate, including modifying the NGINX configuration files and reloading when the certificate eventually expires. To run CertBot, typ**:

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain.com -d www.your_domain.com
```

Enter your email address and agree to the terms of service if required. CertBot will then present you with some options:

```
Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration.
2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access. Choose this for
new sites, or if you're confident your site works on HTTPS. You can undo this
change by editing your web server's configuration.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel):
```

You'll want to type `2` and press **ENTER**. If everything went smoothly, CertBot will update your configs, reload NGINX, and confirm success with a message.

---

## Step 10: Allow HTTPS Port on Lightsail Instance

Obtaining an SSL certificate with CertBot reconfigures your server to run on secure port 443 instead of the default 80. We need to update our Lightsail records to allow this. From the home page click on the menu of your instance and go to **Manage**. Then, click on the **Networking** tab. Add a new value to the **Firewall** section. If you select **HTTPS** from the **Value** dropdown, it should automatically make the **Port Range** 443. Save your changes, and you're all set!

---

## Conclusion

The ability to host your own projects is an important skill as a web developer. Amazon Lightsail offers you a great and inexpensive way to get started. By following this guide, your website should be up and running in no time!

## Bonuses

### Updating Your Live Project

As you make improvements to your project, you'll eventually want to update the live version of it on Lightsail. This is a pretty simple process. Just make sure you have the latest version up on GitHub and `git pull` in the project directory:

```
cd ~/your_repository_name
git pull
```

Then, run the React build script again. If you previously used a swap file to do this step, don't worry about it here. Only reactivate the swap file if the process fails to complete.

```
npm run build
```

Lastly, restart NGINX to show the new changes:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
